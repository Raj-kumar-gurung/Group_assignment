Overview:
This project applies Reinforcement Learning to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a more complex version of the classic tic-tac-toe game. Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe consists of nine small boards arranged in a larger 3×3 grid, making the state space and decision-making much more challenging. In this project, an RL agent is trained through self-play, where it learns from rewards based on winning, losing, or drawing games. Over time, the agent improves its strategy by exploring different moves and selecting actions that maximize long-term rewards. This approach demonstrates how reinforcement learning can handle complex board games that require planning, strategy, and adaptive decision-making.
